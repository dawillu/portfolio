            Look, I know legal pages are boring. But if you're in the EU (especially Italy), you gotta have one. So here we go.

            Just me. No company, no team, no corporate overlords.

            <strong>William Lu</strong>

          <p className={styles.text}>
            This is my portfolio. Think of it as a digital rÃ©sumÃ© meets creative playground. I showcase projects I've built, share what I'm learning, and maybe connect with cool people who want to collaborate.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>What it's NOT:</strong> A store, a business, a subscription service, or anything that makes me money. Just passion projects and proof I know how to code.

          <p className={styles.text}>
            They handle the technical infrastructure (servers, CDN, SSL certificates, etc.) so this site loads fast and stays online.

            <li>Link to my work and share it on social media</li>
            <li>Reference it in articles, blog posts, or presentations (with attribution)</li>

            <li>Copy my content and claim it as yours</li>
            <li>Use it commercially without my permission</li>

          <h3 className={styles.subTitle}>Third-Party Content</h3>
          <p className={styles.text}>
            Some stuff on here (fonts, icons, open-source libraries) comes from other creators. I've done my best to follow their licenses and give proper attribution. If I missed something or got it wrong, let me know immediately.

          <h3 className={styles.subTitle}>Accuracy</h3>
          <p className={styles.text}>
            I try to keep everything accurate and up-to-date. But I'm human. Typos happen. Projects evolve. Technologies change. If you spot an error, give me a heads up.
          </p>

          <h3 className={styles.subTitle}>Availability</h3>
          <p className={styles.text}>
            I can't promise this site will be online 24/7/365. Servers crash, DNS fails, my hosting provider might have issues, or I might be tweaking something. It happens.
          </p>

          <h3 className={styles.subTitle}>Not Professional Advice</h3>
          <p className={styles.text}>
            Nothing here is legal advice, financial advice, career advice, or any other kind of professional guidance. I'm a developer sharing my work, not a certified expert in everything.
            <br /><br />
            If you need real advice, hire a real professional.

          <h3 className={styles.subTitle}>Liability</h3>
          <p className={styles.text}>
            To be blunt: I'm not responsible if something goes wrong while you're using this site. Used some code from my project and it broke your app? Followed a tutorial and it didn't work? That's on you.
            <br /><br />
            <em>(Italian law requires me to say this, but seriously â€” use common sense and test everything in your own environment first.)</em>

          <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>Legal Jurisdiction</h2>
          <p className={styles.text}>
            Since I'm in Italy, Italian law applies to this site. Any legal disputes would go through courts in Milan.
            <br /><br />
            But honestly? If you have an issue, just email me. I'd rather have a conversation than deal with lawyers.

          <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>No Spam, Please</h2>

            My contact info is public for genuine inquiries and networking. Don't abuse it.
            <br /><br />
            Using my email for unsolicited marketing, spam, or shady stuff? That's not cool, and I reserve the right to take legal action if it becomes a problem.

        <section className={styles.section}>
          <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>Changes</h2>
          <p className={styles.text}>
            I might update this page occasionally â€” maybe I move cities, change hosting providers, or add new legal requirements. The "Last updated" date below will reflect any changes.

            By continuing to use this site after updates, you're accepting the new terms. (Standard internet protocol stuff.)
